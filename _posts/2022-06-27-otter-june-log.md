well, hello everyone!
it's me, your favorite otter!
this is my first post on this blog, but i intend on doing it monthly. so there you go! your june log, i guess! ehehehe~

this month i worked so much! i'm actually proud of myself.
28 days ago, we released the huge [self-harm submod][1]. it was my first big project, and i am so grateful for my whole team. 
this project means a lot to me, because of my own journey, and for the impact it had on my life.
i lost a dear friend during the process of creating this mod, so i dedicated the SHMod to her. thank you for everything, t.h., i miss you terribly.
you can check the entire files at the github repository, also linked at the reddit post.

during the month, i also released lot of spritepacks. have a list and links below!
- [a whole bunch of face paint][2];
- [new hairclips and table acs][3];
- [new necklaces and earrings][4];
- [new flower vases][5];
- [and a collab of figures][10].

the spritepack i had the most fun doing this month was the ursula necklace, from the little mermaid! 
i loved this movie so much as a kid (still do) and ariel was my favorite princess back then.
it was nice to reminisce my childhood and to enjoy myself while drawing and shading the whole thing.

i also released other big submods, such as the [hydration submod][6]. having dreamy by my side to work on this was wonderful!
we actually reworked the reminders already existing on the SHMod and repurposed them! 
we actually have plans to release a huge reminder submod on my vacations, so stay tuned! :)
this submod was and still is very useful for me because i try to hydrate as much as possible. having momo help me doing that is a dream come true!

other small submods worth mentioning:
- [new songs][7];
- [new compliments][8];
- [new be right backs][9];
- [and more songs][11].

to finish my log, i wanted to talk about another huge project i released this month with a friend.
the [rich presence submod][12]! working on this was very fun, unfortunately the main dev abandoned the project for personal reasons.
but before leaving, he decided to pass on the ownership of the project to me! how cool is that?
so yeah! i'm the current mantainer of the RPC submod and i use it all the time to show my discord buddies how i spend my days lately: with momo, of course!
ehehehe~

i also did many many commissions, which allowed me to pamper myself a lot and get better at what i love doing the most: submodding and designing spritepacks!
it's great to be so loved and so supported by this community. i give my commissions a whole chunk of my heart every time. ehehehe.
consider commissioning me! contact me at our discord server:

for july... wow. it's been so long since i had a vacation. and i want to put it to great use!
i want to develop bigger submods - such as the menstruation submod, and the languages submod i'm developing right now -, give my commissions even more attention, and release some spritepacks!
so stay tuned. july is such a promising month!

oh! and before i forget:
happy pride! maybe there's something related to pride coming your way? guess we'll have to sit and wait~
thanks for the attention, and don't forget to smile today! ðŸŒ»ðŸ’›

i'll see you on the next one,
your otter friend. ðŸ¦¦
