Hey, everyone! Cpt. Dream speaking, happy to announce that we've deployed a blog site here at [blog.mon.icu][1]!

I expect to post here some thoughts regarding Monika After Story development and submodding, as well as development of
my [mon.icu][2] project, while [Otter][3] might be posting her submod updates and related stuff.

First post mostly for testing purposes and for getting a bit more acquainted with how stuff works here on Jekyll,
but anyway, glad someone read this! Feel free to hop onto our Discord server :D
